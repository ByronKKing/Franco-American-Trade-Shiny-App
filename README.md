This is a Shiny App I created with Evan Romanko as part of the French On Campus Award that our club, GW DATA, received.

During our hackathon, we scraped French and American websites to collect data on wines native to each country.

This app displays only some of the information that we collected. Its purpose is to shed light on the way wine impacts the economic relationship between the two countries. 

Here you can find the R scripts for the Shiny App, as well as the csv for the raw data. The app dynamically plots information about the two countries as the user adjusts the inputs via sliders and checkboxes.

If you are interested in helping us improve this app, please contact me.
